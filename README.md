This repository is the home of the knowledge base and integration guides for integrating Frankly Chat Service into your iOS, Android, or Web application. In order to develop with Frankly Chat Service, we've provided iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs which provide UI and lower level API access as well as a Ruby gem and Python module to give you direct access to our server APIs. For more information on why you should integrate Frankly Chat Service into your brand's application, please visit [FranklyInc.com](http://franklyinc.com/).

##Making Improvements

Frankly Chat Service provides a great way for brands to integrate chat in their iOS, Android, and Web apps in order to build and engage their communities. But of course, that's not possible without developers like you. Have ideas for improving the integration experience? Let us know by [creating a Github issue](https://github.com/franklyinc/franklyinc.github.io/issues/new) in this repo!
