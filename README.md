# Frankly on Github.io

This is the public repository for all documentation and libraries for integrating with Frankly Platform. Check out [franklyinc.github.io](http://franklyinc.github.io) to learn more.

####Making Improvements

Frankly Platform provides a great way for brands to integrate chat in their iOS, Android, and Web apps in order to build and engage their communities. But of course, that's not possible without developers like you. Have ideas for improving the integration experience? Let us know by making a pull request!

####Access & Support

Right now Frankly Platform is limited in access. If you'd like to learn more about how to get access, please reach out to us by emailing [platform-support@franklychat.com](mailto:platform-support@franklychat.com).
